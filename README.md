The Checkers4 class is a Java program that implements a simple two-player checkers game. The core of the program involves initializing a checkers board, handling player moves, validating those moves, and determining the game's end condition. 
It runs entirely in a console-based environment where players input their moves and see the results after each turn.

Board Initialization
At the start of the game, the board is represented by '_' for empty spaces, 'r' for red checkers, and 'b' for black checkers. The constructor of the Checkers4 class places the 
checkers on the board in their standard starting positions, with red pieces at the top and black pieces at the bottom. Additionally, the game keeps track of how many red and black checkers are left on the board, initializing them at 12 each.

Move Logic
Player moves are handled by the getNextMove() method, which prompts the current player to enter their move using a 2-digit number to represent the square they are moving from and the square they are moving to. The move is then checked for 
validity through the validMove() method. Valid moves must adhere to checkers rules, meaning a player can only move their own piece, and movement must follow either a single-space move or a jump over an opponent's piece for a capture. The 
executeMove() method updates the board after a valid move is made, including removing a captured piece and adjusting the number of remaining checkers for the appropriate player.

Gameplay Flow
The game alternates turns between red and black players, starting with red. After each turn, the printBoard() method is used to display the updated board. The game continues until one player has no checkers left, which is determined by the 
gameOver() method. Once the game ends, the winnerIs() method identifies and announces the winner, based on which player still has pieces remaining on the board.

Main Method
The main method of the program initializes the game by creating an instance of the Checkers4 class and printing the initial board setup. The game then enters a loop where it prompts players to make their moves and updates the board accordingly. 
The loop continues until the game ends, and finally, it announces the winner before the program exits.
